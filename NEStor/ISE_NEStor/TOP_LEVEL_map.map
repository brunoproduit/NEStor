WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net
   p1/mov_p1_i[3]_GND_89_o_Mux_37_o is sourced by a combinatorial pin. This is
   not good design practice. Use the CE pin to control the loading of data into
   the flip-flop.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net CTRL/etat_present_FSM_FFd2
   is sourced by a combinatorial pin. This is not good design practice. Use the
   CE pin to control the loading of data into the flip-flop.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:2410 - This design is using one or more 9K Block RAMs
   (RAMB8BWER).  9K Block RAM initialization data, both user defined and
   default, may be incorrect and should not be used.  For more information,

  Number of MUXCYs used:                       888 out of   4,556   19%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:        2,367
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:         1,811 out of   2,367   76%

    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:             218 out of  18,224    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
